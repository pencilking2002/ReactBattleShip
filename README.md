ReactBattleShip

I created a webstorm react app in react-battleship-webstorm-proj

To run the node server :
cd to \ReactBattleShip\react-battleship-webstorm-proj
run "npm start"

I believe the node backend will render our React code server-side for us
You can see all the npm dependencies in package.json






For future reference, creating react-apps in webstorm
What I had to do to create the webstorm project
Install node

Install create-react-app node package
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app my-app
cd my-app/
npm start

Webstorm -> Create New Project -> React App
(node does not allow project names with capitalizations)
