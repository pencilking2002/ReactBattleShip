Started from this tutorial : https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/08/setting-up-react-for-es6-with-webpack-and-babel-2.html

Uses babel, react, webpack
webpack.config.js
 - tells webpack what to bundle and how
 - main.js is listed as the "entry point"

Had issues with path variable for webpack, ran dev server like so:
node_modules\.bin\webpack
